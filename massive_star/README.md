This is the initial model routine for the massive star problem.

The file: 15m_500_sec.txt is a 15 solar mass MESA initial model, with
an aprox21 composition.

It can be converted into the subset of nuclei for aprox19 via
convert_21_to_19.py

This setup uses Ye as the primary composition variable from the initial
model in regions that are in NSE.
